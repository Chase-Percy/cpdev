## A bit about me
{{% /centre %}}
{{< spacer >}}

My name is Chase Percy, and I am a third-year student at Murdoch University studying a bachelor of science double 
majoring in Computer Science and Games Technology.
I have a passion for learning new things and enjoy approaching this through applying myself, such as creating a 
program or algorithm. This approach has allowed me to understand concepts in a way just reading a book or watching
a lecture cannot. It has also allowed me more exposure to programming and problem solving, covering a wide range of 
topics. 

For me, computer science is a perfect mix between creative freedom, problem-solving,
and technology, all of which interest me greatly. Solving problems through understanding and
time, even with making mistakes along the way, is a rewarding experience that drives me to
continue my journey to become a software developer.

While I enjoy the aspects of languages and technologies used to develop the end product, they are not my primary interest. 
Instead, I am more interested in the underlying logic and algorithms used to achieve
the final product. The underlying logic learnt from a project carries on regardless of language
or technology used and is infinitely more interesting to me than a strongly typed language vs one that is not or a 
language that requires memory management vs one that does not. In saying that
I am happy and eager to learn anything new with my full attention!

Working in a group environment is an experience I enjoy as much as working alone and through
the degree I have had the opportunity through several of my units to develop my communication skills
and teaching skills, showing patience and understanding while helping others develop themselves.
Group work and leadership come naturally to me, encouraging others and making them feel welcome,
which is an aspect of IT that I enjoy, even if it means slowing down my progress.

Outside the tech world, I am happily married with two cats and love music. The guitar
is one of my other passions that I invest a lot of my time and attention. I'm laid back and easygoing, happily doing 
my own thing and living a simple and quiet life.

Anyway, now for some more specific information below :smile:
