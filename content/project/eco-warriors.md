## Features developed by me

{{< spacer >}}

### The Hub

The hub was designed to be the central point from which the player could see their progress and choose which
mission they would like to play. As the player progresses their score is used to determine how well they went
on a mini-game and the global stability meter and particle system under the earth are updated to reflect that.

### Dialogue System

The dialogue system was used to teach the player about how to play the game, educational information about plastic
and climate change, and convey the story. It is integrated with the separate Compendium system to provide more detailed
information about a particular topic.

### Turtle Beach Clean Up

This mission was designed to be easily accessible to all users and provide alternative gameplay styles to the two
other missions. The gameplay consists of cleaning up the pollution from the beach and ensuring the turtles don't
get entangled in any waste. The player is taught to only remove non-natural materials from the beach and the shown
how to recycle them afterwards.

### Android & Controller Support

Our game supports android devices and provides separate UI controls to help them play the missions and navigate
menus. Letter boxing is implemented to maintain a 16:9 ratio and keep visuals consistent between platforms. 
Controller support is provided mostly by unity but menu layering issues and UI button highlighting were the biggest
issues to resolve.

### Intro Sequence

I created an intro sequence to help develop the story and let the player understand the current situation regarding
climate change and plastic waste. I also provided a voice-over to make the scene more engaging for the player.
