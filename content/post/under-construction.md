Now I'm not one to blog or write about myself or anything like this really, but my front
page looks bare, and I need some content for it...

So if you see this then yea, my site is still under construction!

... or you scrolled really far down  
... or I never really posted much in the future 
<!--more-->
Anyway, the plan is to demo a bunch of my projects on here and use this as a little  
portfolio for myself seeing as I have no other forms of social media to advertise   
from :smile:

so yea...  
yay for content
